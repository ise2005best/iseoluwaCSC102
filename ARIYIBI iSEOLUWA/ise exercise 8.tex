	Dimensional metrology and alignment methods are significant and vital during different manufacturing processes. Dimension inspection processes play a crucial role in controlling the position accuracy of production \cite{gu2020study}. P. Maresca et al identified the trends in metrology associated with quality control at the industrial level as: fast, more precise, safer and more flexible \cite{maresca2019evaluation}. The highly-automated measuring and control systems demanded by the industries could use several approaches to extract more value from traceable measurements \cite{hall2019opportunity}. An industrial metrology process is used on industrial systems, componets and object to perform inspections, alignment and measurement \cite{ise2005best}. It offers economic argument regarding the effects of intrisic standard technology advances and considers the measuremnt information infrastructure's potential impacts on cost-effectiveness and risks for Iot measuring insturments adoption \cite{kuster2020measurement}. Metrological systems are based upon the principle of a good alignment system. The inspection and alignment of larger scale components with a strict precision were concerned in the high-tech and heavy industry \cite{gu2020study}. Good alignment inspection is one of the most important methods to ensure safe measurement \cite{peng2020inertial}.
